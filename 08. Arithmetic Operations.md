# Arithmetic Operations

We provide you with expressions containing +,-,*,^, / and parenthesis. None of the numbers in the expression involved will exceed `999`.
Your task is to evaluate the expression and `3` display the correct output rounding upto  decimal places.

## Sample Input

### Sample Input 1

    5+50*3/20 + (19*2)/7
### Sample Input 2

    -105+50*3/20 + (19^2)/7
### Sample Input 3

    (-105.5*7+50*3)/20 + (19^2)/7
## Sample Output

### Sample Output 1

    17.929
### Sample Output 2

    -45.929
### Sample Output 3

    22.146

## Script
```bash
read input
printf "%.3f\n" `echo "$input" | bc -l`
```
* `read` - reads the contents of a line into a variable
* `bc` is Bash Calculator, used for performing floating-point mathematical operations
* `printf "%.3f\n"` helps to rounding off the echo output
